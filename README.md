#Project Facet Planning

This repo is where planning docs, mockups and early stage work will be shared in this repo and in the wiki pages you can find [here](https://github.com/ProjectFacet/multifacet/wiki).

##What are we trying to do?

The act of journalism is a multi-faceted process requiring publishing across a variety of platforms in multiple formats. It's also a collaborative endeavor that best succeeds with teamwork and collaboration.

Facet is a project to build open-source software that simplifies the process of planning, assigning, editing and managing content as well as making collaboration between teams and with partners a seamless experience.

The goal is to make the tools that help us manage the storytelling process and make them available to the newsrooms that need them the most. 

##How do we do this?

The development process for Facet will be as open as possible. We'll be sharing what works and what doesn't during the process.  Iterations of the concept, mockups and plans will be available via the repo and we'll post updates as often as we can.

##How can you help?

- Do you work in a newsroom that manages publishing on multiple platforms? Is collaboration with other organizations essential covering the stories your audience need? We'd love to hear about the current systems you are using to do this. What works? What doesn't? What do you wish was better? The goal isn't to just build a tool, it's to build the *right set of tools* and case studies from newsrooms are an essential part of the process.
