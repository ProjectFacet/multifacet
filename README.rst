Project Facet Planning
======================

The act of journalism is a multi-faceted process requiring publishing across a variety of platforms in multiple formats. It's also a collaborative endeavor that best succeeds with teamwork and collaboration.

Facet is a project to build open-source software that simplifies the process of planning, assigning, editing and managing content as well as making collaboration between teams and with partners a seamless experience.

This repo is where planning docs, mockups and early stage work will be shared.
