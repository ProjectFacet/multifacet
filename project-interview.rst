Project Interview
=================

**Planning Exercise**

Since I'm a reporter, interviewing is a big part of how I figure things out.
This page is essentially an interview with the project in order to get down
in a somewhat organized fashion, all of the questions that come to mind 
about what it can and can't do.

*Order not important, answers will probably change*

- Yes, a user can be freelance, staff or member of multiple organizations
